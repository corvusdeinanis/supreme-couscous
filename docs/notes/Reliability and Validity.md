**Reliability** (of a tool) refers to **consistency** of the tool.  The tool must give the same / similar results no matter how many tries / testing and retesting.  

**Validity** is the extent to which the tool measures what it is intended to measure 

standardization - making norms

**validity** is about the accuracy of a measure, i.e., how well it measures what it is supposed to measure.
**Reliability** is about the consistency of a measure, i.e., how well it produces the same results under the same conditions. A measurement can be reliable without being valid, but a valid measurement is usually also reliable. For example, if you use a broken thermometer to measure the temperature of a liquid sample several times, you might get the same reading every time (reliable), but it does not reflect the true temperature of the sample (invalid). On the other hand, if you use a working thermometer to measure the temperature of a liquid sample several times, you should get the same reading every time (reliable) and it should match the true temperature of the sample (valid).
