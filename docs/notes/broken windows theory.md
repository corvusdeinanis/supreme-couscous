theory was introduced in a 1982 article by social scientists James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling

the **broken windows theory** states that **visible signs** of crime, anti-social behaviour and civil disorder create an urban environment that **encourages** further crime and disorder, including serious crimes. 

so, it posits that targeting minor crimes such as vandalism, loitering, jaywalking, etc can help to create an atmosphere of order and lawfulness
