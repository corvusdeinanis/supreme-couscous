The Streisand effect is a phenomenon in which attempts to hide, remove, or censor information can lead to the unintended consequence of increasing awareness of that information. 

It is named after American singer and actress **Barbra Streisand**, whose attempt to suppress the California Coastal Records Project's photograph of her cliff-top residence in Malibu, California, taken to document California coastal erosion, inadvertently drew greater public attention to it .
