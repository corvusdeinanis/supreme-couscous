- **Wordmark**: This type of logo consists of the name of the brand or company written in a distinctive font or style. Examples of wordmark logos are Google, Coca-Cola, and FedEx. Wordmark logos are simple, memorable, and versatile, but they require a strong name and a unique typography to stand out.

- **Lettermark**: This type of logo uses the initials or acronym of the brand or company name, usually in a stylized font or design. Examples of lettermark logos are IBM, CNN, and NASA. Lettermark logos are concise, elegant, and easy to recognize, but they may not be very descriptive or distinctive for new or unfamiliar brands.

- **Symbol / Logo Mark / brand mark**: This type of logo uses an icon or graphic that represents the brand or company, without any text. Examples of symbol logos are Apple, Nike, and Twitter. Symbol logos are expressive, universal, and adaptable, but they may require a lot of marketing and branding to establish a strong association with the name and identity of the brand or company.

- **Combination**: This type of logo combines a symbol and a wordmark or lettermark, either side by side or integrated. Examples of combination logos are Adidas, Starbucks, and McDonald's. Combination logos are descriptive, distinctive, and flexible, but they may be complex or cluttered if not designed well

- **Mascot**: A mascot logo is a type of logo that uses a drawn character to symbolize or promote a brand. The character can be imaginary or real, but it should match the brandâ€™s personality and values. eg. Mr Peanut

- **Emblem**:  aka badge logos, look like crests, combine imagery and text to give classic or a traditional feel eg. Harley Davidson, Starbucks
