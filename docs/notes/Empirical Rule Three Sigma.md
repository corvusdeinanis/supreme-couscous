# 68–95–99.7 rule


is a shorthand used to remember the percentage of values that lie within an interval estimate in a [[Normal Distribution]]: 68%, 95%, and 99.7%

three-sigma rule of thumb (or 3σ rule) expresses a [[heuristics|heuristic]] that nearly all values are taken to lie within three standard deviations of the mean, and thus it is empirically useful to treat 99.7% probability as near certainty
