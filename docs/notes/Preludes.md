The winter evening settes down 
With smell of steaks in passagewats
Six o'clock 
The burnt-out ends of smoky days.
And now a gusty shower wraps 
The grimy scraps
Of withered leaves about your feet
And newspapers frm vacant lots;
The showers beat
On broken blinds and chimney-pots,
And at the corner of the street
A lonely cab-horse steams and stamps. 
And then the lighting of the lamps. 
The morning comes to consciousness 
of faint stale smells of beer 
From the sawdust-trampled street
With all its muddy feet that press
To early coffee-stands,
With the other masquerades
That time resumes,
One thinks of all the hands
That are raising dingy shades
In a thousand furnished rooms.
You tossed a blanket from the bed,
You lay upon your back, and waited;
You dozed, and watched the night revealing
The thousand sordid images
of which your soul was constituted;
They flickered against the ceiling,
And when all the world came back
And the light crept up between the shutters
And you heard the sparrows in the gutters,
You had such a vision of the street
As the street hardly understands;
Sitting along the bed's edge, where
You curled the papers from your hair,
Or clasped the yellow soles of feet
In the palms of both soiled hands.
His soul stretched tight across the skies
That fade behind a city block,
Or trampled by insistent feet
At four and five and six oâ€™clock;
And short square fingers stuffing pipes,
And evening newspapers, and eyes
Assured of certain certainties,
The conscience of a blackened street
Impatient to assume the world.
I am moved by fancies that are curled
Around these images, and cling:
The notion of some infinitely gentle
Infinitely suffering thing.
Wipe your hand across your mouth, and laugh;
The worlds revolve like ancient women
Gathering fuel in vacant lots

free verse

*"a condemnation of modernity, and specifically of urban life. It mainly highlights the boredom of life, with allusions to prostitutes and other grimy scenes to further enhance the disorienting nature of the world in such a time"*

alienating effects of modern urban life 
lonely
desolate, filthy 

**alienated even from controlling their own bodies**; this is shown via the use of synecdoche

they lack agency, emotion, or identity 
mindless
same old routine, day in day out

suggests time is an illusion, all we do are masquerades
we base our entire lives around the clock 

the women in iii - 
is alienated not just from other people, but from herself
her thoughts being projected onto the ceiling shows this 
she is passive like other urban dwellers 

city itself is more conscious and aware than the people living in it


"bed's edge" - she is in between waking and dreaming states, able to perceive reality and visions 

allusions to 'The Leper' by Algernon Charles Swinburne; 
This poem ends with a twist that the lady, who is the speaker's object of affection, and whose feet he is embracing, has in fact been dead six months, as a result of leprosy

this allusion stresses the passivity of the isolated

soul stretched across the sky - alludes to heaven, redemption, Jesus
but quickly dismisses the idea that we can be redeemed ("fade behind a city block","trampled by insistent feet")

in III, the street has a consciousness
	street is more alive than we are
in IV, the street has a conscience 
"implies that the environment is not merely more conscious and more moral than its utterly dehumanized inhabitants, but that it is also like Christ in being potentially able to redeem human beings"
