# Eras of Computing 

Tabulating Era -> Programmable Computers -> Cognitive Computer System Era 

## 1) Tabulating Era (3000 BCE - 1940s CE)
started w idea of storing and altering data
simple calculations
examples - abacus, difference engine, tabulating machine

(tabulating machine - electro mechanical machine designed to summarize info stored on punched cards)

## 2) Programmable Era (1950s CE onwards)
computers could do complicated commands - established a language for them - machine code (binary) - could be expressed through physical hardware 
More programming languages 

## 3) Cognitive Era 
(2010 -> the transition began; still not there)

Allows machines to execute instructions based on learning from large datasets instead of preprogrammed instructions
infinite computing = future of computing 
uses cloud computing aka computing as a service
