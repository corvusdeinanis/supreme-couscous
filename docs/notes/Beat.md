(noun) 
(by extension) An area of a person's responsibility 

In **Journalism**, a beat is an **area of specialization**. Beat reporters are reporters who have a certain specialization (particular issue, sector, organization, or institution over time). They gain **familiarity** and are most likely in continuous correspondence with their sources whom they build rapport with. 

Beat reporters often deal with the same sources day after day, and must return to those sources regardless of their relationship with them. 

Journalist's niche 

A journalist might cover similar stories from time to time, but that does not make them a beat journalist. 


According to 

Primarily a US term for the subject matter or geographical area that a reporter might be assigned to cover, as in ‘the crime beat’ or ‘the Washington beat’. Reporters might still be expected actually to beat (walk) streets and stalk corridors in person but today they are even more likely to be required to monitor[^1]
