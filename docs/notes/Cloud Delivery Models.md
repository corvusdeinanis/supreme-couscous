(aka cloud service delivery model)

# at a glance
**specific, pre-packaged combination of IT resources offered by a cloud provider**

**in terms of customizability and level of control/access granted, IaaS > PaaS > SaaS** 
mnemonic - <mark>I P S</mark>

in terms of ready-to-use, SaaS > PaaS > IaaS

# cloud service delivery models 

## IaaS - Infrastructure as a service
> Resources, self-contained IT environment 
> hardware, network, connectivity are all provided by cloud provider 
> bare infrastructure
> "bare metal"

generally offered as virtual instances

access = full access to virtualized infrastructure related IT resources

cloud consumer - sets up and configures bare infrastructure, manages, monitors software 

cloud provider - provides and manages IT resources like storage, processing, hosting, networking. monitors usage 

**offers as much configurability and customizability as on-premise tech**
**virtual servers**

eg. ec2

## PaaS - Platform as a service
>**ready made environment**
>support the entire device lifecycle
>provides a framework

allows customers to build, test, deploy run, update and scale applications more quickly and cost-effectively than they could if they had to build out and manage their own on-premises platform

access - moderate level of administrative control
limited administrative

cloud consumer - develops, tests, deploys, and manages

cloud provider - pre-configures infrastructure, middleware. monitors usage

eg Heroku 

## SaaS - Software as a service 
software that is  a shared cloud service
used to make a reusable cloud service widely available 
**mostly for end users**

access = front-end user-interface

cloud consumer - uses and configures cloud service

cloud provider - implements and manages cloud service 

eg. Gmail, Microsoft 365,

# Pizza analogy 
- **on-premise** -> your own kitchen, your own ingredients, any type of pizza
- **IaaS** -> (**kitchen** as a service) -> cloud provider manages kitchen, your own ingredients, any type of pizza
- **PaaS** -> (**take and bake**) -> cloud provider manages kitchen and some ingredients, your own pizza but with limited ingredients 
- **SaaS** -> (**pizza delivery**) -> cloud provider manages kitchen, ingredients, and pizza making. You can choose from available options 

**Ease of use vs Customizability**
