by [[John Lennon]]
no countries, no religion, no possessions, no division
no hunger
anti-war 
pacifist 

John Lennon asks us to imagine a world, a dream world where humanity is free of conflicts and barriers. Of peace and brotherhood.

*we are all one country, one world, one people*


"anti-religious, anti-nationalistic, anti-conventional, anti-capitalisticâ€¦ but because it is sugar-coated, it is accepted."


>[!NOTE]- Poem
Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us, only sky
Imagine all the people
Livin' for today
Ah
Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do
Nothing to kill or die for
And no religion, too
Imagine all the people
Livin' life in peace
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will be as one
Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man
Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world
You may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you'll join us
And the world will live as one
