# Full Text

**That is no country for old men**. The young
In one another's arms, birds in the trees,
—Those dying generations—at their song,
The salmon-falls, the mackerel-crowded seas,
Fish, flesh, or fowl, commend all summer long
Whatever is begotten, born, and dies.
Caught in that sensual music all neglect
Monuments of unageing intellect.
An aged man is but a paltry thing,
A tattered coat upon a stick, unless
Soul clap its hands and sing, and louder sing
For every tatter in its mortal dress,
Nor is there singing school but studying
Monuments of its own magnificence;
And therefore I have sailed the seas and come
To the holy city of Byzantium.
O sages standing in God's holy fire
As in the gold mosaic of a wall,
Come from the holy fire, perne in a gyre,
And be the singing-masters of my soul.
Consume my heart away; sick with desire
And fastened to a dying animal
It knows not what it is; and gather me
Into the artifice of eternity.
Once out of nature I shall never take
My bodily form from any natural thing,
But such a form as Grecian goldsmiths make
Of hammered gold and gold enamelling
To keep a drowsy Emperor awake;
Or set upon a golden bough to sing
To lords and ladies of Byzantium
Of what is past, or passing, or to come.

**Byzantium** - Existed in classical time
Present day Istanbul

Poet was at Istanbul 
Wants to move back (in time) to Byzantium 

The speaker describes a world where the old are not welcome. It is a world full of young lovers, birds, and fish, who **enjoy life without thinking about death or anything beyond their physical existence**. 

The old man in this world feels like a **ragged scarecrow**, unless he can keep his soul alive and singing in his decaying body. He has to learn how to do this by himself, since no one can teach him. **("no singing school")** 

That is why he has traveled across the sea to the ancient sacred city of Byzantium. **There, he appeals to the wise men and saints who have died and become part of God’s glorious fire, which resembles the golden mosaics of Byzantine churches**. **He asks them to come out of the fire, spinning like a spool, and teach his soul to sing.** He wants them to destroy his mortal heart, which is bound to his dying body and cannot understand or accept its own mortality, and take him to their eternal world of art. 

When he leaves his body behind, he says he will not take another mortal form.

Instead, he will become a 
**beautiful golden artwork**, like something made by **ancient Greek metal workers for an emperor’s bedroom**
Or **a golden bird on a golden tree**, where he can teach people his everlasting and otherworldly wisdom - his transcendent knowledge of the past, present, and future.

An aged man is but a paltry thing, A tattered coat upon a stick 

Whatever is begotten, born, and dies 

As such, the speaker is basically imagining traveling to a long-dead holy city and talking to mosaic icons on a wall. But that's the point: these sages have transcended old age and mortality through becoming the materials of imagination and of art. They have left their frail, physical bodies behind. The speaker intends to one day join them—and when he does, he’ll leave behind his body forever, and “never take / My bodily form from any natural thing.”

the world of the young and vital has no room for himself
