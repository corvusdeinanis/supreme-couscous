**Statistics** - science - collecting, organizing, interpreting

**Norm** - Average
50% population

[[Averages#1. Mean|Mean]] - a type of average where the sum total is divided by the number of elements


# Measurement
the process of assigning numbers or labels to units of analysis in order to quantify or categorize them. Measurement allows researchers to describe and compare their data using a common metric.

# Measurement Scales

-   **Nominal** measurement is the simplest form of measurement. It involves assigning labels or names to units of analysis without implying any order or magnitude. For example, assigning a number for a gender, 
-   **Ordinal** measurement involves assigning ranks or orders to units of analysis based on some criterion. It implies that there is a meaningful sequence among the categories, but not that the intervals between them are equal.
-   **Interval** measurement involves assigning numbers to units of analysis such that the intervals between them are equal and meaningful. It implies that there is a zero point, but not that it represents an absolute absence of the variable. For example, temperature
-   **Ratio** measurement involves assigning numbers to units of analysis such that the intervals between them are equal and meaningful, and there is a true zero point that represents an absolute absence of the variable. For example, sales, income, costs, age, and height are ratio variables.



# Errors in measurement

- situation
- instrument 
- researcher/measurer
