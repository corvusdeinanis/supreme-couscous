## Cry
Crying is the most important mechanism newborns have to communicate their needs
### three types of cries :
1. Basic Crying 
rhythmic pattern
usually consists of a cry, a briefer silence, shorter whistle (higher pitch than main cry), then a brief rest before the next cry. 
experts believe it might be due to hunger

2. Anger Cry 
like basic crying but excess air forced through vocal cords 

3. Pain Cry 
sudden long, initial loud cry followed by breath holding

Most adults can determine whether an infantâ€™s cries signify anger or pain (Zeskind, Klein, & Marshall, 1992). Parents can distinguish the cries of their own baby better than those of another baby
