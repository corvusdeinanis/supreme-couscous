# Basic Elements of Graphic Design

Basic elements include **line**, **shape**, **form**, **texture**, and **balance**. 
## Line
- A line is a shape that connects two or more points. 
- Lines appear frequently in design; for example, in drawings and illustrations. They're also common in graphic elements, like textures, patterns, and backgrounds.
- **organization**, **emphasis**, or just **decoration**. In the example below, lines have been used to create a flow chart that guides the reader's eye from one element to the next.
- weight, color, texture, and style


## Shape

A shape is any two-dimensional area with a recognizable boundary. 

Shapes fall into two distinct categories: 
1. geometric
2. organic (where the shapes are more free form)

- can help you **organize** or **separate content**, 
  create simple illustrations, or just add interest to your work. 

## Form

When a shape becomes 3D, we call it a form

However, forms don't have to be three-dimensional shapes. **They can also be implied through illustration**, using techniques like light, shadow, and perspective to create the illusion of depth.

In two-dimensional design, form makes realism possible.

## Texture

Texture is the physical quality of a surface. 
can be **implied** through illustration
- texture adds depth and tactility to otherwise flat images

## Balance

Balance is the equal distribution of visual weight (more specifically, how much any one element attracts the viewer's eye). 

Balance can be affected by many things, including color, size, number, and negative space.

## Symmetry
**Symmetrical designs** are the same or similar on both sides of an axis. They feel balanced because each side is effectively the same (if not identical).

**Asymmetrical designs** are different, but the weight is still evenly distributed. The composition is balanced because it calls attention to the right things (in this example, the person's name and company logo).

## The rule of thirds

This imagines your work area divided into a 3x3 grid. 
The focal point of the image is placed on or near one of the grid lines, creating visual balance with the rest of the space.

We find this type of composition appealing because, according to studies, the human eye naturally follows this path when scanning a design.
