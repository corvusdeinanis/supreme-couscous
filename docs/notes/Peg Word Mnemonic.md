mnemonic for memorizing long lists of items in a **specific numerical sequence** by **forming mental associations** with a **list of words that are already known** or can be generated to order. 

A popular set of peg-words, easy to remember because they rhyme with the names of the first ten natural numbers, is: 
one is a _bun_, 
two is a _shoe_, 
three is a _tree_, 
four is a _door_, 
five is a _hive_, 
six is _sticks_,
seven is _heaven_, 
eight is a _gate_, 
nine is _wine_, 
ten is a _hen_
