1. Researchers at Wake Forest University found that **trans fats**, which are created by partially hydrogenated oil, increase the amount of fat around the belly and redistribute fat tissue to the abdomen from other parts of the body. Trans fats may be found in such foods as margarine, pastries, cookies, crackers, and fried and convenience foods.
2. **Visceral fat == dangerous**
3. **verify** - *Extended fasting activates autophagy which clears out misfolded proteins and senescent cells in the entire body. HGH and NAD+ are upregulated. It selects for beneficial gut bacteria that not only do less damage to your digestive tract, but also drive healthy behavior via the gut-brain axis. Then you get into the insane mismatch of the promotion of maintenance of steady blood sugar via constant eating and our actual evolutionary history and the concomitant devastation that has on metabolic health.*
4. **SLEEP IS IMPORTANT**
5. **Check if strength training thing is true** 
   We lose **muscle mass as we age**. Strength training, such as lifting weights helps us build muscle. Muscles use up more energy and therefore burn more calories. 
   ***Weight training builds muscle, and muscle burns more calories than fat-up to three times more. "So the more muscle you have, the more calories you're going to burn. It doesn't end after you leave the gym either. Your body is still torching calories for the next 24 to 48 hours as it works to repair stressed muscle tissues. That's known as the afterburn effect, another name for excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC). The more oxygen you use both during and after a workout, the greater the EPOC. And studies show strength training is one of the best ways to do it.***
   6. Cut down on **refined** products. Whole grain >>>
   7. Add more fiber
   8. Vitamins and minerals
   9. Cutting calories and getting more physical activity is the best way
   10. Focus on healthy protein sources. “Protein keeps you fuller longer, and helps you avoid spikes in blood sugar that come from all-carbohydrate meals,” Srinath says. “For example, if you like oatmeal for breakfast, add some nuts or peanut butter to it for protein.”
   11. 3 hours of break is required between dinner and sleep
