# What is Cloud Computing? 
- it is the **on-demand** delivery of IT resources over the Internet with **pay-as-you-go pricing**

- on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user

# Why?
tldr; do not need to buy, own, and maintain resources; scalable; pay only what you use; global

Look below for elaboration on why

# Characteristics 

on-demand 
	can use whenever needed
	once configured, it can be automated (?) 

ubiquitous access  
	widely accessible 
	this is done using different protocols, devices, interfaces, security technologies 
	tailored to particular needs

elasticity, scalability 

resilience

measured usage

# Advantages
Cost Effective 
	Computing as a **Utility** - Pay for what you use
	Cost sharing of data centers
	minimal to no maintenance required
	Energy consumption saved 
	no need to hire experts 
	servicing and upgrading not required 

**Elasticity** - easily scale up or down dynamically

Remote Access, Collaboration
	can share info 
	access files real time 
	across the globe 

Multiple services offered in a single location 
Speed of operations
Sever Provisioning
Server Cloning
Built-in services for disaster recovery and failover
Data center security and certifications

# Disadvantages
- we do not have physical control of data 
- limited control over physical resources 
- possibility of unwarranted shutdown
- have to rely on third party security
